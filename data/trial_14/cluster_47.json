    "Description": "\u0027Floating on an endless sea of sand, an isolated civilization resides on an island-like vessel known as the Mud Whale. The lives of many of its citizens are short, due to a power they wield called \"thymia\", and they have very little knowledge of the lands beyond their desert home. Young archivist Chakuro wants to acquire as much knowledge as he can in his short lifetime to pass on to future generations, and an opportunity for him to learn more arises when a lone girl is discovered living alone on a similar vessel. She is the first human being the people of the Mud Whale have ever seen, and she possesses a great deal of information that they do not- about the outside world and even the secrets of the Mud Whale itself. With her arrival, everything in their world begins to change.\u0027",
