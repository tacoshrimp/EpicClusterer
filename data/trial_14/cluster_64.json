He so impressed her that she decided to become a prince herself one day. Now, Utena is a teenager at Ohtori Academy who\u0027s athletic and notorious for dressing in a boy\u0027s uniform. When a member of the Student Council humiliates a friend of hers Utena challenges him to a duel, and he accepts only when he sees she possesses a rose seal ring. She soon discovers that this is no normal duel - it\u0027s a bizarre and ritualistic battle that the Student Council regularly conducts. In fact when she wins, Utena finds to her considerable chagrin that she gets to have Anthy Himemiya, a rather docile student, as her \u0027Rose Bride\u0027. If she wants to keep Anthy she\u0027ll have to win more duels against members of the Student Council and others. What is the ultimate purpose of these duels and Anthy\u0027s role as the Rose Bride?\"",
