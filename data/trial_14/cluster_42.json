    "Description": "\u0027Hope’s Peak Private Academy is a super-exclusive institute that gathers the best and the brightest, provides them with a world-class education, and propels them into any career they wish. At least, that’s what the average student Naegi used to think. Having been accepted into a class of 15 students\\xa0through a lottery system, the boy quickly comes to learn that Hope’s Peak is no ordinary school. In reality, he and the group find themselves trapped inside and learn that the only way to \"graduate\" is to murder a fellow student and fool everyone in a trial that determines life or death! Led by the whimsically-cruel, teddy-bear-like Monobear, Naegi and the others must\\xa0do whatever it takes to escape this bizarre, deadly game.\u0027",
