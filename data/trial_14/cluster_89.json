In a desperate attempt to prevent his brother from disappearing completely, Ed sacrificed one of his arms so he could affix Al\u0027s soul to a suit of armor. When his missing limbs are replaced by auto mail parts, Ed bears the name of the Fullmetal Alchemist - the youngest ever State Alchemist and dog of the military. Now, alongside his brother, Ed uses his status within the military to attempt to find any way that he can return their bodies back to their original state.\"",
